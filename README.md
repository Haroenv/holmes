Holmes filters a list of elements based on the value of a `input` in just ~13KB (5KB minified).

## Installation

You can install `holmes` with either `npm` or `bower` under the package name `holmes.js`. For `npm` that looks like this:

```
$ npm install --save holmes.js
```

After which you can add it in your page with i.e. browserify or loading the module in a different script tag.

You have to make sure that you have a `css` rule for the class `.hidden` that hides elements however you want. One option is to have this:

```css
.hidden {
  display: none;
}
```

but this could be any `css` you want.

## Usage

[demo](https://haroen.me/holmes/)

### Simple example

```js
holmes({
  input: '.search input', // default: input[type=search]
  find: '.results div' // querySelectorAll that matches each of the results individually
})
```

### All options

```js
holmes({
  // queryselector for the input
  input: '.search input',
  // queryselector for element to search in
  find: '.results article',
  // (optional) text to show when no results
  placeholder: 'no results',
  class: {
    // (optional) class to add to matched elements
    visible: 'visible',
    // (optional) class to add to non-matched elements
    hidden: 'hidden'
  },
  // (optional) if true, this will refresh the content every search
  dynamic: false,
  // (deprecated) needs to be true if the input is a contenteditable field instead of a
  contenteditable: false,
  // (optional) in case you don't want to wait for DOMContentLoaded before starting Holmes:
  instant: true,
  // (optional) if you want to start searching after a certain amount of characters are typed
  minCharacters: 5
});
```

## Methods and members

For all of the methods you should initialise a new instance of `holmes` like this:

```js
var h = new holmes(options);
```

Then you can use the following methods:

### `.clear()`

You can clear a holmes input programmatically, by using:

```js
h.clear();
```

### `.count()`

You can receive informations on what elements are visible, hidden and in total at any point:

```js
h.count(); // {all: 41, hidden: 34, visible: 7}
```

### `.start()`

Start an even listener for the specified options. Holmes **always** has `.start()` running on initialisation.

```js
h.start();
```

### `.stop()`

Stops the current running event listener. Resolves a Promise when this has been completed.

```js
h.stop();
h.start(); // could accidentally start too soon

h.stop().then(h.start); // might take a small time
```

### `.hidden`

There's also a member `.hidden` that gives the count without a function call:

```js
console.log(h.hidden); // 34
```

### `.elements`

All of the elements that holmes considers. There's also `.elementsLength`

### `.input`

The input that holmes looks in. There's also the last search string as `.searchString`

### `.placeholder`

The current placeholder (DOM Node).

### `.options`

Shows the options chosen chosen for this instance of holmes. You can also set options like this after initialisation.

```js
console.log(h.options); // specified options
```

> note: setting options after it's running might require `h.stop().then(h.start)`

I'd love to find out how people use my project, [let me know](https://github.com/Haroenv/holmes/issues/new?title=add+my+project+to+usages&body=who%7Cwhat%0D%0A---%7C---%0D%0A%40myusername%7C%5Bmy+project%5D%28https%3A%2F%2Flink-to-project.com%29%0D%0A%0D%0ASome+explanation+what+it+is) if you want to be featured!

### Questions?

Compatible up to IE9. For support of older browsers you'll need to polyfill `classList`, `addEventListener` and the `input` event with for example [remy/polyfills](https://github.com/remy/polyfills). I haven't tried this myself yet, so let me know what you used if you support older browsers!

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! Here are some loose guidelines:

* use `feature branches`
* don't make it slower
* explain why you want a feature
* `npm run doc` to recreate the documentation
